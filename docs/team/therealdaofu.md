### Project: SoCompiler

SoCompiler is the sole app that university students will need to streamline their everyday routines. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.
* **Findm Command**:
  * Similar to the existing find command for contacts, this is able to search and filter all module fields with given keyword.
  * It makes sense to have a find command for both contacts and modules, it also allows users to quickly filter modules to get their desired information. For example, a user can search `Friday` to easily see which modules they have on Friday.

* **Code contributed**:
  * [Click here](https://nus-cs2103-ay2223s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=therealdaofu&breakdown=true&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&since=2022-09-16&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other)

* **Project management**:
  * I help to consolidate and create issues that the team need to tackle for the current milestone.
  * I also help review and close pull requests for other team members.

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
  * Previously, `Find` command(now renamed Findp) only searches the names of contacts, it now searches for all fields a person may have.
  * Previously, `list` command only list all contacts, it can only list both contacts and modules.

* **Documentation**:
  * User Guide:
    * Helped design the rough layout of the UG.
    * In charge of fixing most of the UG bugs highlighted throughout the course.
    * Added the sections on Person fields and Module fields.
  * Developer Guide:
    * Added UML diagrams for find command.

* **Community**:
  * PRs reviewed (with non-trivial review comments): _(to be added soon)_
  * Reported bugs and suggestions for other teams in the class: _(to be added soon)_


* **Tools**:
