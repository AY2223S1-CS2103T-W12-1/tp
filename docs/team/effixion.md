## Project: SoCompiler

### Overview

SoCompiler is the sole app that university students will need to streamline their everyday routines.
The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX.
It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **`Module` Class**:
  * Added the `Module` Class and its associated classes. The associated classes include:
    * `LectureDetails`
    * `ModuleCode`
    * `TutorialDetails`
    * `ZoomLink`
    * `AssignmentDetails`

* **`Telegram` Class**:
  * Added the `Telegram` Class that is associated with a `Person`

* **Replaced `Address` with `ModuleCode` in `Person`**:
  * Redid the tests for the affected classes that used `Address` in the `Person` Class.

  * Users can now associate a `Person` to a `ModuleCode` and his/her `Telegram` handle.

* **Documentation**:
    * User Guide:
      * Did the v1.3 iteration of the UG.
    * Developer Guide:
      * Did the `Module` Class Section in the DG.
      * Added UML diagrams for these classes:
        * `Module`
        * `Model`
        * `AddModuleCommand`

* **Contributions to team-based tasks**:
